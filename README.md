# es3-to-special
Want to play Fallout, but still attached to the Morrowind class system? Look no further. This generator will allow you to convert your favourite Elder Scrolls class to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat system.

## How to Run
`python es3_to_special.py`

## How it Works
So, the way the converter works is that you will pick the class you want to generate for. The generated points will still be RANDOM, but they will be based on a seed value rated by proportionately equal values of the given character class.

## An Example Scenario

1. A Monk is deciding, point by point, what his S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats will be.
2. The Monk has a major skill of Hand-to-Hand. 
3. The Hand-to-Hand skill is roughly equivalent to the Agility S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat.
4. Since the skill is MAJOR, the Monk is much more likely to place his next stat into Agility.

Remember, every stat point picked is still RANDOM, but the odds of picking a favoured skill is much higher. 

## Purpose
This is meant to simulate a real character who holds the individual skill traits. However (like in the real world), people of the same class won't always generate the exact same stat points.

Using this system you will generate a much more diverse set of stats that can truly represent a random wanderer of a particular skill class.


Enjoy!
